1.to install npm and to print Hello world in angular js
2.TO print the Product details in angular
3.to install bootstrap details in angular
4.Need to add in styles.css import bootstrap module in styles.css
5.TO create component command  ng  g c  product-list -m app and then refresh it and add <app-product-list> </app-product-list>
6.All code done in product details  in app module shift in the product-list  folder 
7.All images  should be in assets folder 
8.Directives *ngIf, *ngFor ,*ngClass ng-template
	- *ngIf="products.length > 0 else noproducts"
	-*ngFor= "let product of products"
	<ng-template #noproducts>
9.Data Binding
	1.property binding
	 example :string interpolation
		Flow : js ->html  []
	  example:<td><img [src]="product.image" [alt]="product.name" [width]="50"></td> 
	  
	2. Event 
		js <- html ()

		 tHeaderStyle = {
			'background-color': (this.invertStyle),
			'color' : (this.invertStyle ? 'black' : 'white')
		 //cant give colspan 
		 //need to give attr.colspan  
	
	3.two way data binding 

		html->js
		js->html [()]	
		Exmple: [(ngModel)]="showImage"
		To add data binding we need to formModule in app.component.ts
		
10:
Filter Products

	 filteredProducts = [];

  private filter = '';
  set filterBy(fb) {
    this.filter = fb;
    this.filteredProducts = this.products.filter(product => {
      return product.name.toLowerCase().includes(this.filter.toLowerCase())
        || product.description.toLowerCase().includes(this.filter.toLowerCase());
    });
  }

  get filterBy() {
    return this.filter;
  }

  constructor() {
    this.filteredProducts = this.products;
  }

11.Pipes 

Go to angular  documnetiation there are many types o f inbuilt pipes in angular and aslo we can create Custom pipes 
We have created pipes folder there we have convert-to-spaces.ts there we have  implesmented PipeTransform and value is repllce in - to #

and also by creating a pipes we need to import in app.module.ts and @ngModule decoreator

13.Typescript  Functionalitty
 annotaions and interface 
 interface Person {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
}
 Also u could write in another file name as product.ts and array can definr and  import into product file and declare the array over it


14.Lifecycle of angular
ngOnChanges() ngOnInit() ngDoCheck() ngAfterContentInit() ngAfterContentChecked() ngAfterViewInit() ngAfterViewChecked() ngOnDestroy()


15.component communication

To create the star component in place of rating(number )
for that you need to add the font-awesome library in module
go to font-awesome angular


with @Input and @Output Decorator and Emitter and @HostListner
@Input() rating: number; to directly found the child towards his parent 
@Output() ratingClicked = new EventEmitter<number>();
  
We add the  emitter to find parents to the childern need to add in ratingclicked() in product list component and we could found out the rating declared in procuduct.ts


<button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="product.rating =2.5"> Click Changes</button>
  
How to add directives  in the file

ng g  directives highlight  
keep in folder and import it to app component

also add host listener to add with directives

   @HostListener('mouseenter')
   onMouseEnter() {
    console.log('mouseenter');
    this.el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor =  this.highLightColor || 'yellow';
   }

   @HostListener('mouseleave')
   onMouseLeave() {
    console.log('mouseleave');
    this.el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'red';
   }

16.Using Services and Dependency Injection
 to genarate the services aganist the data we need to create service foldere and inject the data againist it 
 command for it is ng genarate services service/product
 get the function wriiten there and in the product-list and app compoment and make it commuted betwwen two function and using the observaable 
 private increment$ = new BehaviorSubject<number>(0);
 private num$: Observable<number> = range(0, 10);

We also make the pakage,json function so that details of products would call aganist it
17.Observable and Reactive Extension

 

18.Routing
-Lazy Loading ->loadChildern() =>import('./products/products.module').then (mod =>mod.ProductModule)
routerlink
router-outlet
need to import router
this.router.navigate(['/products']);
const id: number = +this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id');

Guards:
-CanActivate()
-CanActivateChild()
-CanDeactivate()
-CanLoad()


19.Angular Forms
-Reactive Form need to add ReactiveActiveForm in app module also we need to add Validators -- forbidden validators
-ng Template driven also need FormsModule and also ngModel plays important role here
